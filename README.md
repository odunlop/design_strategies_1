# Key Skill: Test Driven Developement (TDD)

## Background
This repository was created to complete learning exercises of **Week 3** of my Makers Apprenticeship. It focussed on developing my ability to properly plan and carry out unit and feature tests in Ruby.

### **Exercise 1:** 'Remembering Names'

The **user story** I was given for this exercise:
```
* As a student
* So that I can remember people's names
* I want an IRB application that stores the names of people I meet
```

#### **Exercise 2:** 'Basic Bank Account'
The **user stories** I was given for this exercise:
```
* As a customer,
* So that I can keep my money safe,
* I would like to deposit money in my account
```

```
* As a customer,
* So that I can spend my money,
* I would like to withdraw money from my account
```
```
* As a customer,
* So that I can budget,
* I would like to view my balance
```
